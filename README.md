This is an interactive start page for browsers, inspired from my terminal setup.

## Using

There are multiple ways of using this app explained in details on [getting started](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page. Here is a TLDR:

### Fork

You can fork this repository and have direct control over the source code. This is the best way to customize the start page to your liking. Then you can create *Docker images*, *deploy on your server* or *serve it locally*. Check out the [Fork Wiki Page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Fork) for more information.

### Docker Image

Using a Docker image is another convenient way to use the start page. You can either use the image from Docker Hub or Github Registry. Currently supports both **amd64** and **arm64** images. Check out the [Docker Wiki Page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Docker) for more information.

### Online Version
You can use the Online Version (aka. preview version) as well. However, since this is the preview of the project with constant updates, it might break your configurations. I would recommend building your own fork instead. Check out the [Online Version Wiki Page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Online) for more information.


## Customization

This project, at its heart, supports customization to better suit your desktop environment. There are three methods to personalize the project according to your preferences:

You can either
- **Method 1:** Configure your **fork** by editing [settings.json](./data/settings.json) file
- **Method 2:** Use `config edit` command to edit on the fly, by built-in json editor
- **Method 3:** Use `config import <url>` command to import your remote config file from your dotfiles repository
  
Check out the [Configuration](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Configuration) and [Themes](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Themes) wiki pages for more information regarding themes and configuration options.
