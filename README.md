## Using

There are multiple ways of using this app. Here is a quick preview of them. For more information please refer to [getting started](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Getting-Started) page

### Fork

You can fork this repository and have direct control over the source code. This is the best way to customize the start page to your liking.

1. Fork this repository
2. Modify the `startpage.config.js` for the default configuration
3. If you want, you can change the source code to your like as well (optional)
4. Run `yarn dev` command to test it
5. Host locally, create docker image, or deploy to a server

### Docker

Docker is another convenient way to host the start page. You can either use the image from Docker Hub or Github Registry.

<details>
<summary>Using Docker Registry</summary>
<br>

Pull the latest image
```bash
docker pull excalith/start-page:latest
```

Run the image (change the port mapping of 8080 into something you want)
```bash
docker run --name start-page --restart=always -p 8080:3000 -d excalith/start-page
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using Github Registry</summary>
<br>

Pull the latest image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/excalith/excalith-start-page:latest
```

Run the image (change the port mapping of 8080 into something you want)
```bash
docker run --name start-page --restart=always -p 8080:3000 -d ghcr.io/excalith/excalith-start-page
```
</details>

### Remote Config Import

If you still prefer to use the online version, I would recommend you to use the remote configuration import feature. This feature allows you to import your configuration from a URL. This way, you will always have a backup file of your configuration. Please refer to [getting started](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Getting-Started) page for more information.

## Customization

You can pretty much customize everything! Please refer to [configuration](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Configuration) and [themes](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/wiki/Themes) pages for more information regarding themes and configuration options.
